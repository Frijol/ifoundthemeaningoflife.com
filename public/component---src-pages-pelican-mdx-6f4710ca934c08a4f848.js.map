It goes 1-2 times/month, starting very early in the morning. Typically, we arrive the day before in Juneau, get supplies (and maybe check out the museum, hike the mountain, see the glacier, etc.), and then catch a ride to the ferry terminal. This is a great introduction to the remote island, as it's an all day boat ride with eagles and whales through beautiful fjords to Pelican.

This is because the ferry leaves super early (6am I think?).`}</p>\n      <p>{`Juneau is not nicely built for those of us with no car. The airport, the ferry terminal, the shopping center (Lemon Creek), and downtown are all in different places. There are buses. Uber is an option, but not always available (not a lot of drivers). Not to discourage you from Juneau! But you must know this. There are hotels by the airport which offer free shuttle service to the ferry.`}</p>\n      <p>{`There are some neat hikes in Juneau– the Mendenhall Glacier and Mt. Roberts are both cool.

Most people on it know each other. There's a galley where breakfast and lunch are served, and a solarium on the top deck with reclining chairs and heat lamps, so you can sit outside, warm, and watch your passage through the fjords. There are usually whales and eagles.
